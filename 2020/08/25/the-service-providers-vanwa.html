    <p>After 8chan got booted off of CloudFlare for providing safe harbor for terrorists, we all hoped they would go away forever.  I assumed 
for some reason that they moved their servers to Russia like many other terrorism-adjacent sites (stormer, gab, etc…). Someone posted 
on <a href="https://twitter.com/tobypinder/status/1297629492865896451">twitter</a> yesterday that 8kun and qmap domains resolve to the same IP address.  Really?  What kind of psyop does this?</p>

<p>So I decided to see for myself:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="k">for </span>fqdn <span class="k">in </span>qmap.pub 8ch.net 8kun.top<span class="p">;</span> <span class="k">do
  </span><span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="s2">"Domain </span><span class="k">${</span><span class="nv">fqdn</span><span class="k">}</span><span class="s2"> has IP </span><span class="si">$(</span>dig <span class="nt">-t</span> A +short <span class="k">${</span><span class="nv">fqdn</span><span class="k">}</span><span class="si">)</span><span class="s2">"</span>
<span class="k">done

</span>Domain qmap.pub has IP 203.28.246.1
Domain 8ch.net has IP 203.28.246.1
Domain 8kun.top has IP 203.28.246.1</code></pre></figure>

<p>Well isn’t that interesting?  This removes any plausible deniability of the connection between Qmap and 8kun.  The domain names resolve to the same IPv4 address.</p>

<p>Where does this IP address live?  Let’s take a look at <a href="https://search.arin.net/rdap/?query=203.28.246.1">ARIN</a>.</p>

<p><img src="/debunqr/assets/vanwa-arin.jpg" alt="ARIN lookup for 203.28.246.1" /></p>

<p>What are the important bits to glean?</p>
<ul>
  <li>This IP is part of a /24 CIDR block, which indicates VanWa owns the IP address range 203.28.246.0 - 203.28.246.255.</li>
  <li>The IP address block is owned by <a href="https://vanwatech.com/">VanwaTech</a>.</li>
  <li>The IP address range ownership was last changed Tue, 31 Mar 2020 23:58:31 GMT.</li>
</ul>

<p>Their <a href="https://vanwatech.com/">marketing website</a> looks like a somewhat legitimate operation.  Many illegitimate operations have professional looking websites too.</p>

<p>What other domains are hosted on this IP?  <a href="https://builtwith.com/relationships/ip-address/203.28.246.1">BuiltWith</a> can answer. Let’s take a look:</p>

<p><img src="/debunqr/assets/vanwa-connected-domains.jpg" alt="Fucking yikes" /></p>

<p>The very first connected domain in the list is an explicit reference to the illegal content that 4chan/8chan never seems to distance itself from. 
Again, why in the hell is a Trump-stanning SuperSpy© leaking classified intelligence on a message board for fans of the type of sexual exploitation
that Trump is supposedly at war against?</p>

<p>In addition to this domain there are 24 other domains recently connected to that IP.</p>

<p>In a nutshell, Q posts as well as Qmap posts are served from a server located in Vancouver, Washington, USA.  Qmap posts are further processed by
